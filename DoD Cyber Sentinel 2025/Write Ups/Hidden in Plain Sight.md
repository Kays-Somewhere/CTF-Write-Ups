# Question 
Analysts recovered a suspicious image from a threat actorâ€™s social media account. At first glance, it looks like an innocent selfie - but insider reports suggest that a flag might be hiding in the image metadata. Can you extract it?

# Solve
Downloaded the file and Checked the Properties for the flag.

I then uploaded it to:
- CyberChef
- exiftool

The flag was found using exiftool under comment.
