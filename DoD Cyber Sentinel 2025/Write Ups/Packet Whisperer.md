## Question 
Missing the question but it was asking you to find the a username within a packet capture.

# Solve
Downloaded the provided login.pcap file and opened it in Wireshark. I then found a POST /login packet and right clicked on it. I chose "Follow" then "http stream" to follow all the data related to the login process.

“username=ironpotatoadmin&password=C1%7Bmaybe_TLS_would_be_nice%7D”
