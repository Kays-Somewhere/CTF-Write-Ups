## Question 
The malware sample doesnâ€™t appear to print anything useful. But our threat intel team believes it holds a hardcoded configuration string. Can you pull on some strings to retrieve it?

Provided File: hardcodedlies.zip (contained "hardcodedlies")

# Solve

Based on the wording of the question I knew that I had to running strings to extract all of the string data in the file.

I downloaded, unzipped, and copied the file over to Kali. I ran strings and quickly found the flag.
