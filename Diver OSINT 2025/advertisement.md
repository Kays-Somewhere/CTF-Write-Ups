A team-mate started this challenge and asked for help. They where able to gather that this photo was taken in St. Petersburg Russia in front of a digital billboard. In addition, that there was two restaurants named ТОКИО-CITY or “Tokno-City” and ГОРОДСКИЕ РЕСТОРАН-" or "CITY RESTAURANT” was nearby. They were also able find a different photo from a different angle showing a Kacca window or “ticket office” in the building on the left. 

Looking at the original image from the article, I zoomed in and found a grainy map on the right side. Using the general shape, gray rivers, and knowing that it was St. Petersburg Russia, I located the general location. Using the yellow arrow on the map, I narrowed it down to the approximate street. Next, I used the Burger King ad located in the first photo to confirm the street. I then used Google Earth’s Street View to confirm the location.
