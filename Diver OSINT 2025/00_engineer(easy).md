### Question
A software engineer's nameplate was picked up near Tokyo Station. This should be a lost item.
Answer the URL of the website (index page) of the company where this engineer works.

------------------------------------------

After downloading the provided image, I was able to gather:
-	Username(?): kodai_sn
-	They are a software engineer
-	Tech Skills: Java, C#, Go, Python, Node.js, React

Searched for “kodai_sn” and found a GitHub and Twitter account. Both had the same username as the badge but a different profile photo. GitHub and Twitter both had a link in the bio to one another.
	GitHub: https://github.com/kodai-sn
	Twitter: https://x.com/kodai_sn/status/1919704443173400904

In GitHub, there were 3 repos, kodai-sn.github.io, practice, and fork-practice. I checked the kodai-sn.github.io repo first and looked that the only file, index.html. I checked the information gathered from the badge against the html and the skills matched. Now that I confirmed that I was looking at the GitHub created for this challenge, I looked at the Career section where Magneight Software was listed.

Looking up “Magneight Software” led to the company’s website at magneight.com. I entered the website as the flag, and it was correct.
