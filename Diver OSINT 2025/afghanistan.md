When and where was the photo shown at 65-67 seconds in this video taken?

---------------------------------------
The video shown was a news piece by AFP about Operation Khanjar that took place in Afghanistan in 2009. The photo shown at 65-67 seconds showed two American soldiers in uniform jumping in the air playing with a ball in front of storage building with mountains in the background. 

I took a screen shot of the image and did a reverse image search on Google. Next, I checked the Internet Archive next for images from Afghanistan in 2009. Both did not yield results.

After taking a break from this challenge, I check decide to check if AFP (the video maker) had archives of old photos. They did! I searched for “afghanistan ball” for all of 2009. I found the photo at the bottom of the results and hovering over photo gave the flag.
