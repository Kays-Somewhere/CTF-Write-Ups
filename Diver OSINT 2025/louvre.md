### Question
Answer the vendor of one of the Louvre's public Wi-Fi access points that meets the following criteria.
-	Information was collected on 28 February 2025. This can be accessed via online.
-	Determine the vendor according to the BSSID.
Flag format: Diver25{Company Name} (e.g. If the company is Apple Inc., the flag should be Diver25{Apple Inc.}.)

The first thing I did was look up Louvre. It is a famous museum located in Paris, France. Now that I had the location, I looked for an access point as I know that it would list information needed to find the flag.

After logging into wigle.net and looking up the Lourvre, I zoomed in and picked one of their guest WiFi access points. This outputted a bunch of information including the bssid.

Searching for “can you find the OUI based on the bssid” led to the site maclookup.app. Inputting the bssid listed the OUI as Hexlett Packerd Enterprise. This was the correct answer.
### Answer
Diver25{Hewlett Packard Enterprise}
