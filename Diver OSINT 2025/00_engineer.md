### Question
A software engineer's nameplate was picked up near Tokyo Station. This should be a lost item.
Answer the URL of the website (index page) of the company where this engineer works.

------------------------------------------

After downloading the provided image, I was able to gather:
-	Username(?): kodai_sn
-	They are a software engineer
-	Tech Skills: Java, C#, Go, Python, Node.js, React

Searched for “kodai_sn” and found a GitHub. It had the same username but a different photo and a Twitter account with the same username and photo as the GitHub. GitHub and Twitter both had a link in the bio to one another.
	GitHub: https://github.com/kodai-sn
	Twitter: https://x.com/kodai_sn/status/1919704443173400904

In GitHub, there were 3 repos, kodai-sn.github.io, practice, and fork-practice. I checked the kodai-sn.github.io repo and looked that the only doc, index.html. I checked the information gathered from the badge against the html and they matched. Now that I confirmed that I was looking at the GitHub created for this challenge, I looked at the Career section where Magneight Software was listed.

Looking up “Magneight Software” led to the company’s website at magneight.com. I know that it was the web site created for this challenge based on how it was built. The site’s url showed index.html while on the home page and it was very simply built for a company of that type. I entered the website as the flag, and it was correct.
