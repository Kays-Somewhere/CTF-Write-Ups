The link led to a Google Drive with a picture of the helicopterâ€™s complete flight path, take off to landing. On the left there was flight information and a key on the right.

I looked up the coordinates listed in the flight information and that led to a city and its ICAO code. After taking a moment to think about, I concluded that the coordinates were the final position of the helicopter at its landing site. 
Looking at the other end of the path, I found what must be the starting location. Using the city name from the map, I looked up the ICAO code. 

#### Answer 
Diver25{RJTC}
