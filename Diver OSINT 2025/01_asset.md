### Question
Answer the asset number of the smartphone owned by the CEO of the company found in the "00_engineer" challenge.
The first thing I checked was the company’s about page at https://magneight.com/about.html for information. There I found the CEO’s name, Mizuki Sekozaki. I tried searched for “Mizuki Sekozaki” and variations of it including the Japanese translation on DuckDuckGo and Google. I was not able to locate any information.

A team-mate ended up looking at it later and found that on one of the GitHub repos, someone forked and added a document. The username was “mizuki1206edelweiss” which is similar to the CEO’s name. We were unable to gather any other information.

### POST CTF
Looking in the Discord, I found out that we were supposed to find an Instagram that shared the same name as the GitHub user “mizuki1206edelweiss”. It turns out that a lot of international players, including my team, without a VPN connection in Japan were unable to find it. looked up “mizuki1206edelweiss” for myself and was able find the Instagram account of the CEO that had the information needed for the flag.
