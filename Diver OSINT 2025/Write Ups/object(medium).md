-------------------------------

On Google Earth, I looked up 69.216246, 33.378242. It was an object inside of the Russian port Olen'ya Guba port or Olenya Bay. Next, I looked up Olenya Bay on Wiki, read though the page and checked the subs that where listed but nothing matched.

I then found an article talking about a blockade that was put in in the bay had a picture of the object labeled as a secret sub hiding docks.

Within that article there was a link to a Russian wiki page that identified the object as ПД-72, a large dry dock.

Searching for “ПД-72” brough up a blog that talks about the history of the project and related information.

Based on the information found, I tried variations of the flag using different project numbers and shortening the dry dock name. I ran out of attempts and was not able to earn points.

- Diver25{\*missing number\*_Большой плавучий док}
- Diver25{\*missing number\*_док}
- Diver25{13560_док}
- Diver25{13560_плавучий док}
- Diver25{13560_ Большой плавучий док}
