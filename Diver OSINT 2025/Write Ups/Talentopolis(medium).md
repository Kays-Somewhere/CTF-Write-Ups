"Primera edición de Talentopolis" という記事内に登場するステージの位置を答えよ。
Answer the location of the stage appeared in the article titled "Primera edición de Talentopolis".

------------------------------------

The link led to an article where the following information was gathered:
-	Written in Spanish
-	Event took place in 2024
-	Put on by JPL Agency (Young with Leadership Potential) 
-	Called the Talentopolis event 
-	Took place in the San Juan de Malabo neighborhood

I looked up Malabo and found out that it is a city on an island in Guinea. Next, I searched for “Talentopolis event guinea september” in hopes of finding a “join us at” post for that event. I did not find any posts, but I did find another article about the event with more photos:

I then looked up variations of “San Juan de Malabo” intel I found a video of an apartment complex that matched the photos titled “VIVIENDAS SOCIALES DE SAN JUAN MALABO”.

I located the complex on Google Earth and visually matched the photos to the location of the stage. Using the photos for the Ahorageg article, I looked at building behind the bounce house and matched the roof to get the best approx location. First attempt was correct.
