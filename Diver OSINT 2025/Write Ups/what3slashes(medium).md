### Question
When this image was taken, there were three houses in front and one on the right.
Some time later, at the beginning of one of the months, I visited this place again. At that time, one more house had been added to the left side of the front and another was under construction on the right side of the front. At that point, the house under construction did not have a roof, but they were planning to build a blackish roof. In which year and month is "the beginning of one of the months"?
Flag Format: Diver25{YYYY/MM} (e.g. Diver25{2025/06})

The first thing I did was translate and reverse image search this photo with my phone. The logo at the top of the page translated to “Mongolia Mail” and the text below it to “Bumba.Comprehensive.Reinforced”. The string at the bottom of the page calls this address 3-word address.

Checking Mongolia Mail’s website did not provide any new information and did not allow to me to search for this 3-word address. Searching for 3-word address led to a CNN article about the organization who runs this project. At the bottom of the page was the photo, uncropped. No other information was able to be gathered from this new photo however.

Trying to search for the translated name “Bumba.Comprehensive.Reinforced” did not find anything in What3Words. Trying to search for the untranslated name written out by Google translate did not yield anything. Searching letter by letter and letting the search auto populate both with the translated and untranslated name did not yield anything with the location set to Mongolia.

In the last hour and a half despite having three of us look at this problem, we were unable to find the flag.
