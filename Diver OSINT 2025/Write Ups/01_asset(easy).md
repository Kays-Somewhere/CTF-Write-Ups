### Question
Answer the asset number of the smartphone owned by the CEO of the company found in the "00_engineer" challenge.

--------------------------------------------

The first thing I checked was the company’s about page at https://magneight.com/about.html for information. There I found the CEO’s name, Mizuki Sekozaki. I tried searched for “Mizuki Sekozaki” and variations of it including the Japanese translation on DuckDuckGo and Google. I was not able to locate any information.

A team-mate ended up looking at it later and found that on one under kodai-sn fork-practice repo, someone forked and added a document. The username was “mizuki1206edelweiss” which is similar to the CEO’s name. We were unable to gather any other information.

### POST CTF
Looking in the Discord, I found out that we were supposed to find an Instagram that shared the same name as the GitHub user “mizuki1206edelweiss”. It turns out that a lot of international players, including my team, without a VPN connection set to Japan were unable to find it. I looked up “mizuki1206edelweiss” for myself and was able find the Instagram account of the CEO that had the information needed for the flag.
