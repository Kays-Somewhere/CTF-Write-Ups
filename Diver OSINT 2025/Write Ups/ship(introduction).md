### Question
This is a vessel operated by some organization. Answer the number that would remain the same if this vessel were to be sold to a foreign country in the future.
Flag Format: Diver25{ship name in **the local language**_number} (e.g. If the ship name is "ペンギン饅頭号" and the number is 1234567, the flag should be Diver25{ペンギン饅頭号_1234567}.)

This was the last flag I was able to get. I started this question at 10:20 pm and the CFT was ending at 11:00 pm. It was picked as it was a low point easy flag. I was able to solve it at 10:45 pm and enter the flag.

After downloading the image, I brightened it up. I was quickly able to identify the ship as TK1-1401 7JVV. I was also able to make out Japanese characters and “Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology” on the bottom half of the photo.

Searching for “TK1-1401 7JVV”, I found that it is named SHINYO MARU and confirmed that it was a Japanese ship owned by Tokyo University by comparing photos. The only thing that was left was to find out what number does not change on the ship’s sale. 

After a quick query to ChatGPT how "TK1-1401 7JVV" was structured and what would change about that number if sold to a foreign country, I had my answer. The ship’s Registration Number TK1-1401 and IRCS 7JVV both would change if sold to a foreign country. However, the ships identification number (IMO) does not change. 

To get the Japanese name of the ship I set my search to Japan and clicked on a ship information website in the Japanese language. The site gave the ship name and other information such as the IMO, confirmed by translating the site to English.

### Answer
