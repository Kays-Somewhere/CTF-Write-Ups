### Question

In this video, where did the car and bus almost collide? (Flag is a pin)

----------------------------------------------------

The video showed a buses dashcam recording of a close call where two buses almost collided. From the video I was able to gather:
-	The bus line was SBS Transport 
-	The bus lines must be 58 and 52
-	The video was recorded in Singapore
-	The video was recorded in 2013 at 8:04pm on a Thursday
-	Unable to make out any locations or identifiable landmarks
 
The first thing I did was look up the SBS Transport web site. I was looking for a bus route map in hopes of seeing where 58 and 52 shared a stop. I was unable to find a clear map, but I did find a table of bus stops and what lines stopped at them.

Next, I went to Google Earth the looked-up STS Transport bus stops. I then clicked though different bus stops looking for ones that may match the video. I found one that was similar but was not an exact match.

A team-mate ended up working on it and was able to narrow it down to two bus stops by checking where bus line 58 and 52 shared stops. Using a screen shot of the video and Google Earth Street View data from 2013, they where able to confirm without a doubt the bus stop was correct. They submitted the flag.
